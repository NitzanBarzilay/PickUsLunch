* DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BUT THE VALUE OF EACH PREFERENCE (including spacing within and between rows)

--------------------------- PLEASE NOTE ---------------------------
* In any of the "must" preferences (kosher / vegetarian / GF / alcohol free),
  if you choose "must" we will ensure that the meal you'll receive explicitly matches that preference,
  but it might disqualify options that does not match it explicitly (e.g. if you choose "must be vegetarian",
  vegetarian meals who's name doesn't explicitly mention that they're vegetarian will be disqualified).
  Therefore, take into consideration that any "must" condition you choose, may limit your possible meals options considerably.
* In any of the "prefer" preferences (spiciness, cuisine), if you choose "prefer" we will try to choose a meal
  that matches that preference, but it is not guaranteed.
